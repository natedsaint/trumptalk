      <h3>Why would you build this?</h3>
      <p>President Trump's administration has refused to speak directly with media except
         in combative interviews. They have removed their contact phone numbers and
         information from their site. It seems that there's no way to get into
         contact with him. Until now.</p>
      <h3>Ask stupid questions, get stupid answers.</h3>
      <p>This bot does not learn, it does not evolve. It barely understands what
        you say by using a parts of speech parser. I think it's a pretty decent
        imitation of the source material.</p>
      <h3>Mad? Glad? Do more.</h3>
